# Rebalance Macro (Rebalance.md)

Use this macro to quickly run the Rebalance script on selected monster tokens.

**Instructions:**
1. Select one or more monster tokens on the map.
2. Run the following command in chat:


```
!rebalance --cr ?{Desired CR}
```

The script will whisper the GM with the current stats for each selected monster and suggest adjustments for encounter balance.

*You can customize the script to suggest specific changes based on party level or desired difficulty. See Rebalance.js for details.*
